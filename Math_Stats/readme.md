Statistics is used to process complex problems in the real world so that Data Scientists and Analysts can look for meaningful trends and changes in Data. In simple words, Statistics can be used to derive meaningful insights from data by performing mathematical computations on it.

Several Statistical functions, principles and algorithms are implemented to analyse raw data, build a Statistical Model and infer or predict the result.

In the link below, you will understand the importance of Math and Statistics for Data Science and how they can be used to build Machine Learning models.
