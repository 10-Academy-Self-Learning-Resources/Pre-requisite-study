To learn about the world of Python for Data Science, you donâ€™t necessarily need to have an indepth understanding of the language. Just the basics will be enough.

Be sure to do the following topics
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-lists-examples/" >Python Lists</a></li> 
  <li><a href="https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-list-comprehension/">List Comprehensions</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-tuples-syntax-examples/">Python Tuples</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-dictionaries/">Python Dictionaries and Dictionary Comprehensions</a></li>

You can then proceed to set up your environment. <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">Anaconda</a> is advised because it is easy to set up.  It is a freemium open source distribution of the Python programming languages for both small and large scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computation. Anaconda has all you need for your data science journey with Python.
